So here's another post that I'm trying to share.
This time from Google Drive but do _you_ care?

As a reader you'll be looking at HTML,
but they are just words to you. What the hell?

What does a code block look like by default?

```javascript
    function letUsSee() {
        let plugin = `markdown-all-in-one`;
        console.log(`${_.upCase(plugin)} has made writing Markdown pretty convenient in VSCode`)
    }
```
