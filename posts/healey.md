title: When will i move?
---

Here's some text about my upcoming move which has been pending for three weeks and affecting my mood.

It all started when I saw a mouse. Actually, I didn't see the mouse first - I saw his poop on one of my favorite hoodies.

This is a problem I am willing to approach but I think it's easier to just move.
